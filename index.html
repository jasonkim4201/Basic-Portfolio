    <p id="bio">Hello! My name is Jason Kim! I am currently learning how to code over at Rutgers over the next few months and
      am hoping I will be able to become a competent developer at the end of this course. I am 26 years old and went
      attended Penn State for college and earned a degree in International Politics with a concentration in National
      Security. Computer stuff was always an interest of mine, and sometimes flirted around with the very basics of
      html as a kid or, on ocassion, editing text files on some video games.
      <br><br>

      I enjoy jogging and try to make time for it when I can. Hopefully when you are viewing this I will have some
      more knowledge to build a nicer looking website. </p>
